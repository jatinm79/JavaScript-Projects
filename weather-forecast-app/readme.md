# üå§Ô∏è Weather App

The **Weather Web App** is a real-time weather tracking application built using the core front-end technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides users with instant weather information for any location they search, leveraging external APIs to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather conditions.

Designed to be **lightweight**, **fast**, and **responsive**, the app serves as both a **utility** and a **demonstration** of:

- Dynamic web programming
- API integration
- Front-end development principles
